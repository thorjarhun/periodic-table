# periodic-table
The reimplementation branch for a beautiful project originally by Caleb Wolfe, who graciously allowed me to practice refactoring on his original project, available as the initial commit.

With the knowledge gained from partially refactoring the original project, this branch is a rewrite from scratch.
Notable differences include:
- No jQuery dependancy
- No use of stylesheets
- No initial content in html markup
- Uses a single SVG element
